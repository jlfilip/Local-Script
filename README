--- localscript ---

'localscript' is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to execute Javascript directly on a page of your choice, without having to use the browser console.

File saves trigger an extention and window refresh for the tab you're using localscript with.

This was a tool I created while writing some Javascript to manipulate Anaplan models. 

It has increased the efficiency of my workflow by a non-negligable amount while reducing my headache significantly.
